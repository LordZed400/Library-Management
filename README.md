# Library Management System

This program creates a simple Library Management System by allowing users to Add, Modify or Delete records of Books.  
Like a Library, the details of the Books as well as their **IN**/**OUT** status are stored.  

This Program uses *Enumerated Data Types* and *Structures* to Store data.
